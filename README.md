# Rotating-Image-Gallery
A dynamic rotating image gallery created using HTML, CSS, &amp; Javascript
In the project, I created a compelling image gallery with rotating photos and two navigation buttons. JavaScript timers and event listeners were used to dynamically change the pictures for seamless navigation. Rotating photos with CSS transform improved the aesthetics of the gallery. This approach provided a captivating and visually attractive user experience. The gallery's visual richness could be appreciated with a three-second rotation interval and intuitive navigation buttons.
